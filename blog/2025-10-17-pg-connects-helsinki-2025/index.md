At the beginning of October, Taru Tech was able to attend [Nordeep 2025](https://nordeep.com/), the Nordic’s largest deep tech business summit.

We had a great panel discussion with [Gabriele Aimone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrieleaimone/), CEO of [Playnest](https://playnest.games/), one of our pilot customers,  hosted by [Eetu Helminen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eetu-helminen/) from [Urban Tech Helsinki](https://www.linkedin.com/company/urban-tech-helsink). We had a fun and candid talk where we explored how close collaboration between companies can accelerate the development of innovative technologies and services.

We also had the great priviledge meeting and chatting with some veteran gaming and AI serial entrepreneurs and investors, [Peter Vesterbacka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petervesterbacka/) and [Kristoffer Lawson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/setoque/), receiving great feedback and validation about our technology as well as great advise for the road ahead.

Other meaningful chats and connections were [Jarmo Ruohonen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarmo-ruohonen-2748917/), Head of Innovation Services @ Aalto University, [Sébastien Gianelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastien-gianelli) from [SANDS.vc](https://sands.vc), and [Giovanni Burresi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanniburresi/) and [Lukas Dustand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-dust-807639161/) from the Swedish startup [Scailab](https://www.scailab.se).

All in all, despite not being a gaming industry specific event, Nordeep was a valuable space to meet with like-minded people and companies, as well as to meet investors and relevant connections.
