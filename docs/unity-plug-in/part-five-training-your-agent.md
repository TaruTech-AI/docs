# Part 5: Training Your Agent

**Time to train**

You've configured your agent's senses and actions. Now it's time to train.

let's configure the plugin to connect to the Horizon Tech cloud.

1.  In the Unity menu, go to Horizon Tech > Settings.
2.  This window manages the connection to our training service. Fill in the Trainer IP Address and Trainer Port provided to you.

In Horizon Tech > Setup Playtest Agent window, you'll see a "Start Training" button.

This is different from Unity's normal Play button.

*   Use Unity's Play button when you want to test your game mechanics locally without connecting to the trainer.
*   Use the "Start Training" button when you are ready to connect to the Horizon Tech cloud and begin a training session.

Click "Start Training", and your game will enter Play mode, now connected to our powerful cloud trainers, learning and improving based on the observations and actions you defined.

Happy training
