# Game Observations

Observations are real-time inputs the AI agent receives while playing, forming the foundation for its decision-making.
- Visual inputs capture the gameâ€™s visual state (e.g., screenshots of the board or environment).
- Vector inputs provide numerical data like remaining moves or goals.
- Goal or style inputs guide agents toward specific play-styles or objectives.
These observations are processed to train agents that simulate gameplay. The resulting simulated sessions generate the metrics used for prediction and analysis.

Below are some example observations for a sample tower defense game called "Arena Masters":
